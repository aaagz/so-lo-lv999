# Comprehensive Plan for Single-Page TODO App at /v6

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps to implement a single-page TODO application under the route `/v6` in the NextJS project. The app will connect to the existing API route `/api/v6/todos/route.ts`, which currently supports GET (list todos) and POST (add a new todo). The API does not handle individual update or delete operations, so these may not be fully functional and should be addressed in a future task.

### Endpoint Details
- **GET /api/v6/todos**: Retrieve and return a list of all TODO items.
- **POST /api/v6/todos**: Add a new TODO item with a `title` and `completed` field.

### File Structure
- **Frontend Page:** A new page will be created at `src/app/v6/page.tsx`.
- **API:** The API route is already existent at `src/app/api/v6/todos/route.ts`.

## Mermaid Diagram
Below is a Mermaid diagram illustrating the interaction between the frontend and backend for this TODO app. This visual aid details how the components communicate prior to the need for automatic switch.

```

### Detailed Steps for Implementation

1. **Create the Frontend Page:** Develop a user interface to list, add, remove (if API supports delete), and mark todos as completed.
   - **File:** Create `src/app/v6/page.tsx`
   - **Content:** Client-side code using React hooks (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`) to fetch and display todos.
   - **Key Features:**
     - Display todos with their `id`, `title`, and `completed` status.
     - Form for user-inputted `title` to add new todos via POST.
     - Input field for `title` and a submit button.

2. **Handle Data Fetching:** Use the API endpoints directly.
   - GET to `/api/v6/todos` to load todos.
   - POST to `/api/v6/todos` with a JSON body for adding new todos.

3. **Add Error Handling:** Include basic error handling for network issues and API response errors.

4. **Style and Layout:** Basic styling using Tailwind CSS or inline styles, ensuring the UI is clean and user-friendly.

## Next Actions
